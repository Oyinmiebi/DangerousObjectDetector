# DangerousObjectDetector
This repository describes a project to detect dangerous objects using a custom YOLOv11 model trained on the DangerousObjects Roboflow dataset. The model runs on a RaspberryPi 4, and lights up an LED as well as takes and sends a screenshot to relevant personnel when a dangerous object is detected.
